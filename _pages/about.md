## Interests
I am a coastal engineer with a background in civil and environmental engineering. My main professional interests include:
- **Nearshore Hydrodynamics**: Understanding the physics of water wave propagation, fluid motion, and coastal processes
- **Numerical Modeling**: Applying numerical methods to create tools for modeling physical processes of the natural and built environment
- **Machine Learning**: Applying ML algorithms to metocean data to reduce dimensionality, forecast, hindcast, and learn physics
- **Coding**: Integrating scalable and well-documented workflows for metocean data
- **Coastal Infrastructure**: Applying coastal engineering principles for civil engineering design and disaster planning


## Educational Background
- **B.S Civil Engineering** (Cornell University, 2023):  concentration in Fluid Mechanics/Hydrology/Water Resources Engineering and minor in Environmental Engineering. 
- **M.C.E Civil Engineering** (University of Delaware, 2025): concentration in Coastal Engineering. Thesis focused on applying machine learning algorithms to build surrogate models for wave statistics from FUNWAVE-TVD outputs. 
- **Ph.D. Civil Engineering** (Univesity of Washington, current role): focusing on coastal engineering with the Derakhti Lab in Environmental Fluid Mechanics
