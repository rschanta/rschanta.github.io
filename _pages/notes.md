## Hydrodynamics Model Derivations
Entering my master's, I found it difficult to understand wave models with just a civil engineering math background. The attached notes represent my attempt at explaining models simply, assuming only knowledge of differential/integral calculus, introductory physics, introductory fluid mechanics, and at least some conceptual understanding of multivariable calculus and partial differential equations.
